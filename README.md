Project name: Halcyon

Features:
This project is mainly divided in two sections: Converse and Diary. Converse is a chatting platform and Diary is similar to a digital diary.

 In the "Converse", features like scheduled messages, i.e. decide when the message will be sent by
selecting date and time. Another feature like selecting mood so that people in your
connections know how you are feeling and emotionally support you. Also a global chat for all the users of Halcyon to connect and find new people.

In the "Diary", features like password protected entries and goal tracking are implemented for safe and secure entries and to support self-growth.
